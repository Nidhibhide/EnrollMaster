I designed and developed EnrollMaster, a course enrollment application using Java Server Pages. This system allows students to enroll in multiple courses seamlessly. I utilized XAMPP as the local server for the development and deployment of the application. My primary role involved participating in the coding phase and managing the database. Through this project, I ensured a smooth and efficient user experience for course enrollment.

Tools Used : HTML5 , CSS3 , BOOTSTRAP , Java Server Pages(JSP) , MYSQL , XAMPP (local Server) , JavaScript
